# README: Duplicate Detection and Removal in Airplane Accident Dataset

## Introduction
This code demonstrates how to load an airplane accident dataset into a Pandas DataFrame, perform data preprocessing, and identify and handle duplicate entries within the dataset.

## Prerequisites
Before running the code, make sure you have the following libraries installed:
- Pandas
- datetime

## Code Overview
The provided code accomplishes the following tasks:

### 1. Loading the Dataset
The dataset is loaded from the 'airAccs.csv' file using the Pandas library.

### 2. Data Preprocessing
- The 'Date' column is converted to the datetime format for consistency in calculations.
- The 'Aboard' column is converted to the integer format using the 'Int64' data type.
- The 'accident_delta' column is created to calculate the time difference from January 1, 1997.

### 3. Exact Duplicate Detection
The code identifies and counts the number of exact duplicate rows in the dataset.

### 4. Removing Exact Duplicates
Exact duplicates are removed from the dataset based on a specified attribute subset, including 'Date', 'operator', and 'Aboard'.

### 5. Probable Duplicate Detection
The code identifies probable duplicate rows by considering multiple columns, such as 'Date', 'operator', 'planeType', and 'Aboard'. These rows have similar values in these attributes.

### 6. Investigating Probable Duplicates
To filter out probable duplicates, further investigation is recommended. Manual inspection and examination of additional columns can reveal similarities or patterns that indicate duplicate entries.

### 7. Decision on Handling Probable Duplicates
Based on your findings from investigating probable duplicates, you can decide whether to remove or merge the entries. Consider factors like matching descriptions, locations, and other relevant attributes.

## Usage
1. Ensure that the required libraries are installed.
2. Place the 'airAccs.csv' dataset file in the same directory as the code.
3. Run the code to load, preprocess, and analyze the dataset for duplicates.

## Conclusion
By following the steps outlined in this code, you can effectively detect and handle duplicate entries in the airplane accident dataset, contributing to data quality and analysis accuracy. Remember to adjust the investigation process according to your specific dataset and requirements.
